This week we're joined by Michael AME, a retail investor active in community development and in highlighting the efforts of the readers, writers and builders who are seeking to raise the floor for collective understanding among investors. These are intentionally complicated markets, and simplifying them isn't in everyone's interest. Michael tells us more about his personal journey to become invested and how he became interested to build a community and bring attention to niche but crucial details uncovered by it's members.
