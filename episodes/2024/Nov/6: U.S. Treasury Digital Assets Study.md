Taking Stock Episode 51: https://x.com/i/spaces/1OdJrXAEbezKX

Today on Taking Stock we'll follow up on last weeks discussion with an examination of the Treasury Department's study on Digital Assets, which also was released in October 2024. The Treasury takes a more direct approach reviewing how tokenization of treasuries could impact the market currently developing in the crypto space including effects on stablecoins, bitcoin, memecoins, and coins yet to come. It is a data driven and conservative take which is worth the read if you're interested to see how the coming years may integrate emergent blockchain technology. Make sure to check out some of the excellent included graphics and charts to follow along, as we'll praise heavily the diligence displayed by this team even if dismayed by the way in which the Treasury department is recommending to utlize distributed ledgers.
