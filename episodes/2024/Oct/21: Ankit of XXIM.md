## From Chives

I've scheduled Ankit as a guest on Monday 10-21 at 9pm EST, to accomodate his schedule. Ankit has described his project as an effort to bridge the gap of understanding between disparate sections of retail involved in the financial sector, and during the show we'll talk more about his personal history and the specific goals he has, and the routes he sees to accomplish them.

Check out XXIMs content and podcast at https://www.youtube.com/@XXIMpod/videos, where both Chives and John Wooten have appeared so far as guests to provide perspective on their areas of knowledge.

## From John

Ankit has been folling the Syndicate for [some](https://x.com/Sehgal_ankit/status/1570516380751110146) [time](https://x.com/Sehgal_ankit/status/1713290697304932618) on a completely [grassroots](https://discordapp.com/channels/955819881989808128/1059573570122023022/1063895241205231646) basis. He has extensive crypto, business, and euntreprenrial background&mdash;hope some of this might show in his perspective on the future of education. I bring this up because it was something incredible he told me about before our first interview, and we might get to hear a little bit about it. üéôÔ∏è [^ints]
