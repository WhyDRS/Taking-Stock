We will be having @triplejuicebox (Gorillionaire2) as a Taking Stock guest this Friday 10/18 at 5pm EST. 

Gorillionaire has been a key contributing member of the WhyDRS team since before WhyDRS.org launched in Feb 2023. The WhyDRS Database originally evolved out of a personal project that he started, and he continues to be the core of its maintenance and growth. A review of the [GitHub page](https://github.com/WhyDRS) will show his commitment to publicly documenting improvements and welcoming community input so that we can always improve the free information and educational resources that are core to the DRS mission. I want to hear from Gorillionaire: What has it been like contributing over time, what is your connection with the mission and how can others can get involved?

If there's anything else you'd like us to ask or cover, let us know here and we will!
