These are some preliminary ideas, nothing perscriptive!

After another week of stellar collaboration between the community, might we discuss efforts to empower the community further? Perhaps how we might give everyone the power to inspire action in their own unique way? 

For instance, we had some incredible [technical resources](https://discord.com/channels/1102309240145707049/1102309241026515069/1295486490872381450) found through independent research. Could there be a way to identify common goals and collectively work towards shared outcomes, employing the constructive peer feedback so evident in this conversation?

i am not sure if this would be the right time, but with the political disjoint in the country...and world, perhaps a set of rational political issues to bring up for younger inspired activist investors to take the baton, and see if it can get legs. certainly there are super smart people in here, and maybe a few could get enough talking points to break the strong hold elites have on politic and finance???
